***

## **Installations**

**Installations** are "folders" where the data for each Installation is stored. Thsese contains worlds, configs, mods, maps...

***

## **Servers**

**Servers** are similar to regular **Installations** but they wheight a lot less and work a bit different.\
**Servers** contains both the **Version** and the **Installation** on the same folder and they will only work as server, not as client.
