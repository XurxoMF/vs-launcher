# Install/Manage Mods

**Mods** are amazing. With them you can change everything you want to make the game perfect for you, but installing them was not the funniest thing to do. Now with VS Launcher you can install, update and uninstall all the mods you want with just a few clicks!

{% hint style="info" %}
Mods will be downloaded from the official ModDB!
{% endhint %}

## Installing Mods

Installing mods is sooo easy. Just go to the **Mods** page, click on the mod you want to install and then on the install button!

This will install the **Mod** on the **Installation** you've selected on the left menu.

Check out this little guide explaining how to do it:

### What the install button colors mean?

To make it easy for you to find the version you need I made the install/update button change it's color depending on compatibility. This is what each color means:

<table><thead><tr><th width="85"></th><th width="478">What it means</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f7e9">ðŸŸ©</span></td><td>100% compatible. If the author added the version AND patch from your Installation on the compatible game versions of the mod version.</td><td><p>Mod 1.20.4</p><p>Installation 1.20.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f7e8">ðŸŸ¨</span></td><td>Should be compatible. If the author added the version from your Installation on the compatible game versions of the mod version.</td><td><p>Mod 1.20.X</p><p>Installation 1.20.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f7e5">ðŸŸ¥</span></td><td>Not compatible. If the author didn't added the version from your Installation on the compatible game versions of the mod version.</td><td><p>Mod 1.19.X</p><p>Installation 1.20.X</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Updating Mods

You can update mods from the [#installing-mods](install-manage-mods.md#installing-mods "mention") page but the easiest way is to use the **Mod Manager** page of your desired **Installation** as there you'll have them separated if they have updates. Check out this video:
