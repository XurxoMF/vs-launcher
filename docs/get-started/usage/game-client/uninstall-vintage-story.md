## Delete an Installation

Deleting **Installations** is easy, just follow this tutorial.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you check the `Delete data` checkbox your worlds, configs, backups and so on will be deleted FOREVER!\
If you want to keep them don't check this option so VS Launcher only deletes the **Installation** from the list but keeps the files on the same folder.
{% endhint %}
