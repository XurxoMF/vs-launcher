# Installation Backups

**Backups** will save a compressed copy of your data on a separated folder so if your worlds got corrupted you can just restore a backup and continue playing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Backups are not a 100% secure, if the world was already damaged there is nothing you can do about it. I have tried them many times and they have never failed but they may fail at some point, I hope they don't.
{% endhint %}

## Configuring Backups

**Backups** are easy to configure and use. You just have to change, if you want, the folder where you want your backups to go and then configure the **Installations** you want to backup. Check out the video:

## Making Backups

Once you've everything configured you can go to the **Installations** page and click on the backup button on the **Installation** of your choice.

Also if you've it configured to make automatic backups it'll make a backup before starting the game when you press **Play**.

## Restoring Backups

If something broke on that **Installation** you can restore a backup going to the **Installations** page, clicking on the three dots button on the **Installation** you want and then the restore backup button.

There you'll be able to delete backups and restore them by clicking the restore backup button.

## Deleting Backups

If you want to delete some backups to free some disk space you can just go to the **Installations** page, click the three dots button on the **Installation** you want and then the restore backup button.

On that page you can delete the backups by clicking the trash can button.
