# Backups

Backups will save a compressed copy of your data on a separated folder so if your wolrds got corrupted you can just restore a backup and continue playing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Backups are not a 100% secure, if the world was already damaged there is nothing you can do about it. I have tried them many times and they have never failed but they may fail at some point, I hope they don't.
{% endhint %}

## Configuring Backups

Backups are easy to configure and use. You just have to change, if you want, the folder where you want your backups to go and then configure the Installations you want to backup. Check out the video:

## Making Backups

Once you've everything configured you can go to the **Installations** page and click on the backup button on the **Installation** of your choice.

Also if you've it configured to make automatic backups it'll make a backup before starting the game when you press **Play**.

## Restoring Backups

If something broke on that **Installation** you can restore a backup going to the **Installations** page, clicking on the three dots button on the **Installation** you want and then the restore backup button.

There you'll be able to delete backups and restore them by clicking the restore backup button.
