### Add the Vintage Story Version

**Versions** are the base game files like assets, code, executables... By default this ones can be found on the next folder:

* **Windows:** `C:/Users/YourUsername/AppData/Roaming/Vintagestory`
* **Linux:** The folder where you extracted the `.tat.gz` or `/home/YourUsername/.local/share/Vintagestory/`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't confuse it with `VintagestoryData`, that's the Installation(data) folder.
{% endhint %}
