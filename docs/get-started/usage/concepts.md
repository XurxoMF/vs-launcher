# ðŸ“– Concepts

## VS **Versions**

**Versions** are the base game files like assets, code, executables... This is what you download on the VS Launcher `VS Versions` page.

***

## **Installations**

**Installations** are "folders" where the data for each Installation is stored. These contains worlds, configs, mods, maps...

***

## **Servers**

**Servers** are similar to regular **Installations** but they weight a lot less and work a bit different.\
**Servers** contains both the **Version** and the **Installation** on the same folder and they will only work as server, not as client.

{% hint style="info" %}
Servers are under development. They will be available in the future.
{% endhint %}
