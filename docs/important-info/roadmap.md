## Planned for the future

* [ ] **Mod manager**\
  A page to install and manage the mods of your installations.
* [ ] **Mod auto-updater**\
  A way to update mods automatically. Mod manager will allow you to see mods with updates but you'll have to manually update them if you want to.\
  Automatic updates will be something similar but it'll download the updated version automatically. This will not be easy and it'll not work as expected because there are mods working on 1.20.X for example but there is no 1.20.X tag on them so... I've no way to know if the mod works on the version you're using or not.
* [ ] **Clone installation button**\
  A button to clone an installation to another folder. This will not clone worlds, configs and so on. It'll only clone mods, Installation settings(backup settings, start params...).
* [ ] **Auto new game version importer**\
  When a new version of the game is launched I've to manually install it, compress the files and upload them to the VS Launcher API for you to download. I want to make this automatic. Less work for me and you don't have to wait hours for me to upload it.
* [ ] **Server support**\
  A way to install and manage servers! Just install a new server on the version you want, install the mods you need and press start!
* [ ] **ModPack suport**\
  A way to export your installed mods and send them to your friends as `.json` probably so they can import them on the installation they want and all the mods will be automatically installed.
* [ ] **Game configs importer**\
  A way to import the config from one installation to another so you don't have manually change the graphics, audio, keyboard... settings again.
* [ ] **Permanent session**\
  When you start a new Installation you'll have to manually login. If you play on multiple Installations this is a pain. I'll try to copy the session from one Installation to the others so you don't have to do this.
* [ ] **Welcome guide**\
  A little step by step guide for new people. Little popups teaching you how to use the launcher the first time you open it.
